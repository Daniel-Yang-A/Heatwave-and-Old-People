# The Impact of Heat Waves and Urban Heat Island to Older Adults

## Description
This project is aiming at investigating whether urban heat island effects and heat waves are correlate to the incidence of heat-related diseases among the aged, and how they affect the life-expectancy of older adults. 

The repository contains:
- an analysis of the impact of heat waves and urban heat island to elders
- a case study which focuses on the weather conditions and heat-related diseases among the aged located in California from 2011 to 2015
- an interactive surface to calculate heat index

## Background
1. heat wave definition
   The heat waves in this project are identified for a temperature-humidity threshold: one day or longer periods where the daily maximum Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGTmax) > 28 °C. This WBGTmax thresholds follow the International Standards Organization (ISO) criteria for risk of occupational heat related heat illness. 

2. Analysis Scope and Measurement
   - Heat-related death data is collected from [California State: Death Profiles by County by Month, 1970-2020](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/death-profiles-by-county). This provides monthly mortality data in California counties. Thus, our analysis is all measured county-wise and monthly from 2011 to 2015 within California. 
   - Daily Station-wise temperature and humidity information is crawled from [Western Regional Climate Center (WRCC)](https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/wea_monsum.pl?ca). The geometry (latitide and longtitude) information is then utilized to map the station into counties, the scope of each county is retrieved from [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/california-counties). The following feature engineering is based on this processed county-wise data. ![Meteorological Monitoring Stations in California Counties](https://gitlab.umich.edu/506-heatwave-and-old-people/heatwave-and-old-people/-/raw/main/result/map_station_county.png){width=50%}

## Operating Instruction
1. All the files in the src directory is the codes that is highly generalized from codes shown in the notebook directory.
2. To run the code, just download the whole project and run /src/main.R. It would directly refer to other source code. By running main.R, you can generate a case study which focuses on the weather conditions and heat-related diseases among the aged located in California from 2011 to 2015. You can also input other files to DIY a new case study and explore further.

## Interactive Results
To better stress and illustrate our data manipulation results, we build an interactive application so that user can see the overview of our datasets with preferred features. The sample picture are listed below.
